    <h4>• Why learn Python in 2023? There are many reasons, some related to career and earnings, others to personal development. In this article, I will demonstrate why learning Python should be one of your New Year’s resolutions.</h4>

    <br><br>
    <h2><b>1. Python Is Easy to Learn</b></h2>
    <br>
    <h6>Python is a perfect fit for a first programming language. If you are completely unfamiliar with Python or only at the very beginning of your learning journey, don’t worry! The Python programming language is very intuitive and its learning curve for beginners is relatively small</h6>
    <br>
    
    <h5>Python is used for:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Web development (server-side)</li>
        <li>Software development</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>System scripting</li>
    </ul> 
    <br>
    <h5>What can Python do?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
        <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
        <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Why python?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
        <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
        <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
        <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>2. Python Devs Are In-Demand and Well-Paid</b></h2>
    <br>
    <h6>If you take a look at Google Trends with PYTHON as a search term, you’ll notice that interest in Python has been constantly increasing over the last decade:
    </h6>

    <br><br>
    <h6>According to Stack Overflow, Python is one of professional developers' MOST WANTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES in 2022. Almost 18% of developers who are not developing with Python have expressed interest in developing with it. That’s a lot!</h6>
    <br>
    <h6>Why is Python so trendy? Python was popular as a scripting language in the 1990s and early 2000. It’s currently living a second life with the increased importance of data science and machine learning. Almost all modern tech companies, including Google and NETFLIX, use Python.</h6>
    <br>
    <h6>If you are interested in becoming a data scientist, I highly recommend the mini-track PYTHON FOR DATA SCIENCE. It lays the programming foundations needed to start working in the field of data science. After completing it, you’ll be able to write simple data processing scripts and data visualizations. You will be prepared to further your education in programming, in Python, or in another language of your choice.</h6>
